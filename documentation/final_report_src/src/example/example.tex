\paragraph{Example Paragraph Heading}
This is an example of how to include a figure and table reference. Please see Figure \ref{fig:my_label}. Please see Table \ref{table:my_label}. Tables and figures are automatically included in the list of tables and list of figures at the beginning of the report.


% Here is how you insert a figure
% Copy and paste this or start typing \begin{figure} when you want to add a figure
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{PATH-TO-IMAGE}
    \caption{Example Figure}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}




% Here is how you make a table 
% Just copy and paste this if you need to make a table and just it as needed
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
% \footnotesize
\caption{Example table}
\label{table:my_label}
\begin{tabular}{|
>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{.2\textwidth}|
>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{.6\textwidth}|
}
    \hline
     \textbf{One} & hello
     \\\hline
     \textbf{Two} & hello
     \\\hline
     \textbf{Three} & hello
     \\\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Here is how you do equations}
Hello this is some text and I would like to include an equation in-line. You can do this simply by 
surrounding your equation with dollar signs. $E = mc^2$. If you want it to show on the next free line 
centered without an equation number you can write it like \[E = mc^2\]. If you want to write a bigger 
equation and want it to be on it's own, numbered or not, similar to a figure, you can use the following
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{2} = 0.5
\end{equation}


Please see Equation \ref{pythag} 

\begin{equation}
    \label{pythag}
    a^2 + b^2 = c^2
\end{equation}





\section{This is how you do two figures side by side}
