\chapter{Acknowledgements}

Most of all, our team would like to thank our client, Professor Sridhar Krishnaswamy, for giving us this project and spearheading the aerospace concentration at Northwestern. We all would like to continue into this field in the future and are thankful for the opportunity to step into it at a deeper level through the concentration.

We would like to also thank Caleb Bergquist, the owner of DroneDojo. His straightforward videos and extremely upbeat personality really helped us through this project. We would not have a functional drone without him!
