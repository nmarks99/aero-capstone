# Rotor Powered Rocket Lander
The team will develop a landing system capable of landing a small rocket vertically at a designated target zone, without the use of traditional combustion engines.
The product will function completely autonomously from the start of its descent (more than 10 meters but less than 50 meters) until stable landing on the landing 
pad. The device will also adhere to typical guidelines and mission goals set by the NASA Student Launch competition in order to benefit future NUSTARS (Northwestern 
University Space Technology and Rocketry Society) competition teams. Finally, the product will be designed using concepts and methods which allow for modularity 
between rockets of different scales.
